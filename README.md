# CPSC 340
## Getting Started 

To activate the python environment, download and install either [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once installed, run this in the root of the repo: 

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml 
```

This will create a new python environment with pandas, numpy and jupyter installed. You can activate it by: 

```bash
$ conda activate 340-dev
```
